## Biography

I'm now a first-year graduate school student in [National Chiao Tung University](https://www.nctu.edu.tw/). I received my B.S. from [National Chi Nan University](https://www.ncnu.edu.tw/ncnuweb/) in Jan 2018. 

My research interests include reversible data hiding, visual cryptography, digital watermarking, and design and analysis of algorithms. From Feb. 2017, I upload the mini project on my [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmVQun_KSwvPnRBDWSX8gRw/featured) channel almost every week where topics including **image processing, game designing, and something interesting & informative**. Also, the entire code are all put in [Github](https://github.com/hbyacademic), and you can contact me via [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/HBY.academic).
